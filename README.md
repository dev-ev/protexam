# protexam
## Inspect your quantitative proteomics results using this streamlit-powered dashboard. The dashboard is specifically tailored for the comprehensive examination of the result of isobaric labeling-based quantitative proteomics.

Package *protexam* is dependent on multiple packages, such as *streamlit*, *bokeh*, *matplotlib*. Because of that, we strongly advice to use a virtual environment for *protexam*. *venv*
